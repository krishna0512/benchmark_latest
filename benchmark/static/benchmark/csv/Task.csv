Block Detection;The objective of this task is to detect block (paragraph) level text and output the Bounding boxes for the blocks.;1
Line Detection;The objective of this task is to detect the bounding box around all the lines in a given page.;1
Word Detection;The objective of this task is to detect the bounding box around all the words in a given page.;1
Page Recognition;It recognizes all texts present in a page or a printed document image.;1
Block Recognition;Given a cropped image of a block size text you have to recognize the text in the block.;1
Line Recognition;The objective of the task is to recognize each line of text present in a page or a printed document image.;1
Word Recognition;It recognizes each individual word present in a document.;1
End-to-End Block Recognition;Combination of the block detection and block recognition you have to output both the bounding box of the block and text contained in the block.;1
End-to-End Line Recognition;Combination of the line detection and line recognition, you have to output both the bounding box of the line and text contained in the line.;1
End-to-End Word Recognition;Combination of the word detection and word recognition, you have to output both the bounding box of each word and text contined in the word bounded box.;1
Page Recognition;It recognizes all texts present in a page or a printed document image.;2
Line Recognition;The objective of the task is to recognize each line of text present in a page or a printed document image.;2
Word Recognition;It recognizes each individual word present in a document.;2
Text Localization;The objective of this task is to detect text locations in the image in form of bounding box that corresponds to words;3
Word Recognition;The locations (bounding boxes) of words in the image are assumed to be known. Word Recognition consists of identifying the characters and recognizing these characters as a word from a cropped image patch.;3
End-to-End Word Recognition;Its objective is to localize and recognize all the words in the image in a single step.;3
Text Localization;The objective of this task is to localize all the words in the form of bounding boxes and track all the words over the video sequence.;4
End-to-End Word Recognition;Its objective is to localize and recognize all the words in video sequence. This task requires that correctly recognized words are also correctly localized in every frame and tracked correctly over the video sequence.;4
