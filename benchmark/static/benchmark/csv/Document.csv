Printed Documents;There are many machine printed documents. Due to large volumes of documents of unconstrained font types adn image quality, it is very difficult to process printed documents in application of digital library.
Handwritten Documents;Analysis of handwritten documents is very difficult due to variations in handwritten style, font, ink etc. It is important for digitized historical handwritten documents, verification of author's authentication etc.
Scene Text;Text in natural scene images usually contains a lot of semantic value such as product names, shop names, location names and traffic signs. Recognizing these texts is an important step for understanding those images. It has many content based image and video applications including content based web image search, video information retrieval and mobile based text analysis and recognition. Unlike printed documents, recognition of text in natural scene images are more difficult due to various complex factors like: the large variations in backgrounds, texttures, fonts and illumination conditions and occlusion.
Text in Video;Nowadays the size of the available digital video content is rapidly increasing. This fact leads to need for fast and effective algorithms for information retrieval from videos. Textual information in videos constitutes a very rich source of high level semantics for retrieval and indexing. For this purpose, detection of texts in videos are important task. Text detection and recognition in video is also a challenging computer vision problem. It has numerous real world applications including video indexing, assistive technology for the visually impaired, automatic localization for businesses, and robotic navigation. Due to motion, large variation in background, color, font, texture, illumination; and occlusion, it is very difficult to localise and recognise text in video sequences.
