ACTIVE BUGS

->		No validation for the 'Add submission' form in MyMethods

-> 		label-required css class not working when placed in style.css for some reason (even after adding !important)
		temporary fix: placed the declaration of that css class in leaderboard.html custom_css
		But have to investigate why this is not working!

SOLVED BUGS

-> 		Validation not displaying when login.

-> 		When going from printed.html to leaderboard.html while selecting the GO button of leaderboard, the tab 'leaderboard' in leaderboard.html 
		does not get selected automatically even though there is a js code to do that.
		This problem doesn't exists for overview button when going from printed.html to leaderboard.html, the overview tab is selected.
		Solution: 
		{{ overviewTabselected }} in leaderboard.html custom_js was outputting empty value in case of false instead of 'false'
		resulting in the js of that portion failing.
